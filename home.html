              <h5 class="card-title">Senior Technical Program Manager, Infrastructure Storage, Google Cloud</h5>
              <p class="card-text"> A problem isn’t truly solved until it’s solved for all. That’s why Googlers build products that help create opportunities for everyone, whether down the street or across the globe. As a Technical Program Manager at Google, you’ll use your technical expertise to lead complex, multi-disciplinary projects from start to finish. You’ll work with stakeholders to plan requirements, identify risks, manage project schedules, and communicate clearly with cross-functional partners across the company. You're equally comfortable explaining your team's analyses and recommendations to executives as you are discussing the technical tradeoffs in product development with engineers.

                Our goal is to build a Google that looks like the world around us — and we want Googlers to stay and grow when they join us. As part of our efforts to build a Google for everyone, we build diversity, equity, and inclusion into our work and we aim to cultivate a sense of belonging throughout the company.
                
                As the Infra-Storage Technical Program Manager, you will manage a portfolio of technically complex projects that will ensure Google can continue to scale its mission to "organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful." You will work closely with our Engineering and Finance counterparts on projects as diverse as determining the pricing for various layers of the stack to determining the composition and deployment path for the next generation of storage machines.</p>
